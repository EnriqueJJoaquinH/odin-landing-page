# The Odin Project's Landing Page Project

## Description

This is the second project of the **Foundations Course** of **The Odin Project** curriculum. It is intended to put in practice the knowledge acquired on **CSS Styling Sheets**, specifically using **Flexbox** to recreate a given layout. Since the focus of this project is the style, not the content of the website, dummy text and placeholders had been used to fill up the page.

> **Landing Pages** are often used as the first contact a new user has with a website, but differs from a Homepage in its main purpose, which is **inviting** or **persuading** the user into taking a specific action, often related with **acquiring** a **product** or **service**

- The layout of the website tries to imitate the layout of a landing page 

- The webpage has the following structure:
    
    - A navigation bar, with a logo and multiple links

    - A hero section, with a headline, a subheading text, a Sign Up button, and an image

    -  An information section, with a matrix layout divided into four identical cards, each containing an image and a description

    - A quote section, which might contain a testimonial 

    - A call to action section, where the Sign Up button reappears accompanied by some text to persuade the user

    - A footer section, which only contains the copyright notice
